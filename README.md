# About Twill

Twill is an open-source Laravel package that helps developers rapidly create and deploy a custom content management system that is beautiful, powerful, and flexible. 

Crafted by leading product design and development studio [AREA 17](https://area17.com), Twill aims to provide a content management experience that is as enjoyable for developers as it is for publishers. By standardizing common features and functions without sacrificing developer control, Twill makes it easy to rapidly deliver a feature-rich admin console that matches the needs of your application exactly. 

# Benefits overview

With a vast number of pre-built features and custom-built Vue.js UI components, developers can focus their efforts on the unique aspects of their applications instead of rebuilding standard ones. 

Twill offers:
* No data lock-in – create your own data models or hook up existing ones with zero constraints
* No front-end assumptions – use Twill within your Laravel app or take a headless approach 
* No bloat – turn off features you don’t need
* No need to write/adapt HTML for the admin UI
* No limits – extend and modify as you see fit
